In retirement, I am continuing to offer services related to my experience most of which you can see on [Linked-In](https://Linkedin.com/in/jbdavid).


Links to Publications are under construction 

I hold:
- BSEE from Oregon State University
- MSEE from the University of Maryland, College Park

I am a Life Senior Member of the IEEE, a veteran of Silicon Valley with decades of experience working on Analog and Mixed-Signal projects with Qualcomm, Cadence Design Systems, Innophase, Scintera Networks and others to find design issues with chips prior to the most expensive and time-consuming tasks of chip fabrication.
